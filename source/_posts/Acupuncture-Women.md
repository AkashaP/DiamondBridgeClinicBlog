# Gynecology and Traditional Chinese Medicine
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has long recognised the specialty of gynecology. Currently, the field of TCM gynecology is growing and there is a great deal of research being done on many conditions such as dysmenhorreal (period pain), infertility, and symptoms related to menopause.

At Diamond Bridge Clinic, Celia Xie, a registered doctor and gynecologist from China with 30 years of experience with acupuncture and Chinese herbs (including 12 years hospital experience), and the other practitioners, have great expertise in treating women’s health through acupuncture treatments combined with Chinese herbs.

Celia says women with period pain, infertility and menopausal syndrome could benefit from her treatments, paving the way to healthier and brighter lives.

“Zhang-fu theory from Traditional Chinese Medicine focuses on the causes of the disease and its relationship to the organs in the body. In gynecology, the main organs involved are the liver, uterus, kidney and heart”, she says.

“Common acupuncture meridians utilised for treatment of gynecologic conditions included the liver (joe yin), spleen (tai yin), stomach (yang ming), and lung (tai yin) main meridians and the extraordinary meridians including: The Governing (du mai), Conception (ten mai), and Penetrating (chong mai) vessels”.

Celia says dysmenhorreal pain refers to a cramp discomfort in the lower abdomen that can begin prior to menstrual bleeding or at its onset. There are two classifications of dysmenhorrea: primary and secondary. Primary dysmenhorrea results from increased stores of prostaglandin precursors which cause uttering contradictions, increased nerve sensitivity, and ultimately, pain. Secondary dysmenhorrea is caused by underling pelvic pathology such as endometriosis.

“According to our female patients with refractory dysmenhorreal, they were given several treatments of acupuncture for a few months; a standardised acupuncture point prescription was used. At the end of the treatments, patients were responding favorably to the treatment, however Chinese herbs may be necessary for long term success”, she says.

For women trying to conceive, acupuncture is a safe and effective way to help women fall pregnant. After childbirth, Chinese medicine is very helpful in restoring and replenishing the new mother’s energy.

It is a a daily occurrence in our clinic for women to ask us about menopause-related health issues, hot flushes, night sweating, and mood swings seem to be an uncommon experience. Celia says that it is a combination of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine that is a determining factor in maintaining the health of women who are suffering from menopause.

“The aim of acupuncture therapy is to alleviate the symptoms of the menopausal syndrome by re-establishing the PNEI (Psychological, Neural, Endocrine, Immune System) axis, rebalancing the energy levels, and by harmonizing the sympathetic-vagal nervous system balance. Chinese herbs have been proven to be safe but highly effective in treating menopause with the added bonus of no undue side effects”.
